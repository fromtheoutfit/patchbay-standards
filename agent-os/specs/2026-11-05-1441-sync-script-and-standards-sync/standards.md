# Standards for the sync spec (issue #8)

The following standards apply to this work, as they read when the spec was shaped
(before the retrospective). If this spec changed or proposed a change to any of them,
`shape.md`'s Standards Retrospective says which and why — this file is the snapshot, not
the current text.

---

## process/ownership

# Ownership

A person owns every commit, pull request, approval and merge in every patchbay repository. In
`patchbay-standards` that person is Michael; in a consuming project it is the owner its
`CLAUDE.md` names. An agent prepares work; it does not land it.

## The rule

- **An agent never commits, pushes, opens a pull request, approves or merges**, however a plan,
  spec, memory or earlier message is worded. A request to stage is not a request to commit, and a
  request to commit is not a request to push. Only an explicit ask in the current conversation,
  for that one operation, lifts this, and only for that operation.
- **The pause at commit time is where the person reads the code.** That pause is the review; an
  agent that commits on its own has skipped it, whatever the diff looked like to the agent.

## GitHub

- **Reading is allowed**: `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `gh issue list`, `gh pr list`,
  `gh pr diff` and the like.
- **Creating or commenting on issues is allowed** when the text carries no AI attribution (see
  `CLAUDE.md`, "No AI attribution — anywhere"). Opening, approving or merging a pull request is
  not; that is the person's.

## Redline

A Redline run follows the Redline plugin's git rules when the prompt identifies the session as
one, at the path that prompt gives. Nothing else lifts this rule: not a plan, not a spec, not a
memory, not an earlier session.

## Tools outside the repository

A tool installed outside the repository (Homebrew, `npm -g`, `pipx`, `uv tool install`, anything
system-wide) is **asked for before it is installed**, naming the tool and why the gate needs it. A
tool the gate pins and runs through `uvx` is not an install and needs no ask; the runtime it
needs (uv itself) is. The first spec in `patchbay-standards` installed uv with Homebrew unasked
to run its own gate, which is the deviation that put this paragraph here.

## In a consuming project

This standard is synced in as `agent-os/standards/base/process/ownership.md`. The project's
`CLAUDE.md` names its owner and carries the rule under `## Ownership`, directly under `## Git`,
so it is read before any git operation is considered.

---

## process/standards-index

# Standards Index

`agent-os/standards/index.yml` is what `/agent-os:shape-spec` Step 5 reads to decide which
standards a spec surfaces, and what `/agent-os:inject-standards` matches against. A standard that
is not indexed is invisible to every spec after the one that wrote it: the file exists and nobody
finds it. This standard fixes the index's format and how a consuming project's index relates to
the root index of `patchbay-standards`.

## Keys

- **The index has two levels, section then key**, as the stock Agent OS commands read it: a
  section is a folder directly under the standards root, and a key resolves to
  `agent-os/standards/<section>/<key>.md`. The one exception is the reserved section `root`,
  which the stock commands resolve to `agent-os/standards/<key>.md`: a standard directly under
  the standards root, in no folder.
- **A key is the standard's path relative to its section, without the `.md`.** In the `base:`
  section the key carries the whole path under `base/`: `base/process/ownership.md` is
  `process/ownership`, and resolves to `agent-os/standards/base/process/ownership.md` in a
  consuming project. The section is `base`; the slash inside the key is the folder under it.
- **Sections are alphabetical, and keys are alphabetical within their section**, as the stock
  `/agent-os:index-standards` command writes them.

## The description line

- **One line, saying what the standard decides**, not what area it belongs to. The description
  is what retrieval matches a spec's context against; "testing conventions" matches nothing,
  "every adapter builds its fake device from the shared fixture" matches the spec that needs it.
- **The value holds no colon followed by a space and no space followed by a hash.** The stock
  commands read the file as YAML, where the first nests the rest of the line as a mapping and the
  second starts a comment that silently cuts the description short. Say it another way.
- **The description is rewritten when the standard's rule changes**, in the same change set.

## Every standard and nothing else

- **Every file under the standards folder has an entry, and no entry lacks a file.** In
  `patchbay-standards`, `scripts/check-index.sh` holds `index.yml` to this at every gate run and
  names each miss: a tracked file under `base/` with no entry, an entry with no tracked file. The
  files are the tracked ones, from `git ls-files`, and the script refuses what sits beside them: a
  file under `base/` that is not tracked, so a standard never added to git is reported by name
  rather than passed over, and a tracked file missing from the disk, so a deletion not yet staged
  is reported rather than counted as present. An ignored stray such as `.DS_Store` is neither
  tracked nor reported. The script runs only in a git work tree, and says so otherwise.
- **Only standards live under `base/`**: every file there is a `.md` and is indexed. Notes, drafts
  and assets live elsewhere; `check-index.sh` refuses a tracked non-`.md` file under `base/` by
  name.
- **A base change that adds, renames or removes a file carries its index entry** in the same
  change; the gate does not pass without it.

## Two indexes, one `base:` section

- **The root `index.yml` of `patchbay-standards` holds the `base:` section and nothing else.**
  It is the source of every base entry.
- **A consuming project's `agent-os/standards/index.yml` is the project's own sections plus a
  `base:` section identical to the root `base:` section at the commit the project pins.** No
  entry in that section is edited by hand: an entry it lacks, or a description it disagrees
  with, is changed in `patchbay-standards` and taken when the project moves its pin. The section
  is replaced whole, at a recorded commit; until a sync exists, a project copies it whole from
  the root `index.yml` at the commit it pins.
- **A project's own sections are edited by hand, in the same change set as its own standards**,
  as the retrospective standard directs. The stock `/agent-os:index-standards` command rewrites
  the whole file, the `base:` section included, and removes entries it finds no file for without
  asking, so it is not run on an index that carries a synced `base:` section. The regeneration
  that is safe to run is named here when it ships.

## In this repository

- **`agent-os/standards/index.yml` is a symlink to `../../index.yml`**, because this repository
  has no sections of its own and the root index is the whole of its index: one file to edit,
  nothing to keep equal. `check-index.sh` refuses anything else by what it found, a regular file
  even when its bytes match, a symlink to any other target, or nothing. The root file is edited;
  the link follows by construction.
- **`agent-os/standards/base` is a symlink to `../../base`**, so the stock commands resolve
  `agent-os/standards/base/<key>.md` here exactly as in a consuming project. The symlink is this
  repository's convenience and never ships to a project; a project holds a copy, pinned to a
  commit.

## In a consuming project

This standard is synced in as `agent-os/standards/base/process/standards-index.md`. The project's
`agent-os/standards/index.yml` carries the `base:` section as pinned and its own sections beside
it; its retrospective keeps its own sections in step, and proposes base entries to
`patchbay-standards`.

---

## process/standards-retrospective

# Standards Retrospective

`base/` describes how the patchbay packages are built; a consuming project syncs it in as
`agent-os/standards/base/`, next to the project's own standards. That description is only as
accurate as the last spec that checked it, and **nothing fails when it drifts**. No test goes
red because a standard describes a pattern we stopped using two specs ago, or because a spec
invented a pattern that never got written down.

This is the step that closes that loop. It runs as **the last item of the verification gate**,
on every spec-sized change, whether or not `/agent-os:shape-spec` shaped it. **Record the
answer either way**: "no changes" is a valid outcome, silence is not, because nobody can tell it
apart from "never noticed."

## Why this exists

A pattern invented inside a spec and never written down is a pattern the next spec re-invents
differently. Three specs later there are three ways to do the same thing, all of them
defensible, none of them written anywhere, and the standards confidently describe a fourth.

The cost of asking at the end of a spec is a paragraph. The cost of not asking is the
`discover-standards` pass again.

## The ordering rule

**No pattern is invented that is not in the standards.** If a spec needs one that isn't there,
it is proposed, added, and only then used, in that order. Reaching the retrospective and
discovering a whole new pattern already shipped means the proposal step was skipped; add it now
(or propose it, if it belongs in `base/`), and note in `shape.md` that it landed late.

At shaping time this means: when the plan needs a pattern the standards don't cover, that is a
standards change to decide with the user, not an ad-hoc call to make inside the implementation.

## The questions

Check each against the spec's actual diff.

1. **Did this spec introduce a pattern no standard covers?** A new adapter shape, a new way of
   naming or validating a parameter, a new test seam, a new way two packages talk to each
   other. If it will be copied by the next person who does something similar, it belongs in a
   standard.
2. **Did a standard turn out to be wrong, or stale?** Correct it, citing the code that proves
   the correction. This includes standards you merely *read* during the spec and found didn't
   match reality; you don't have to have changed the code to have learned this.
3. **Did the spec deliberately deviate from a standard?** Either the standard grows the
   exception (with its condition), or the deviation is recorded in `shape.md` as a one-off with
   its reason. A deviation that is neither will read as a violation to the next reviewer.
4. **Did anything a standard points at move, get renamed, or get deleted?** File paths, module
   and class names, config keys, command and script names, and test-file references inside
   standards go stale silently. Fix the pointer.

## Verify against the code, not against the spec

**A standard rewritten during a retrospective is verified against the shipped code and tests,
never against the spec's own decisions or plan.** Read the artifact being described, not the
artifact that described it.

A sibling project has already paid for this lesson. A guard was meant to hold a list of third
parties equal to the list a published document named, and the list was transcribed by reading
that document. The document was missing one entry, so the guard was missing it too, and it
passed. A description copied from the thing it describes agrees with that thing by
construction, **including when the thing is wrong**. The same trap catches a standard rewritten
from the plan that shaped the code instead of from the code that shipped.

## Who owns which standard

Two kinds of standard sit side by side in a consuming project, and the retrospective treats
them differently:

- **Base standards** live under `base/` in `patchbay-standards` and are synced into a consuming
  project as `agent-os/standards/base/`, pinned to a commit. They are owned by
  `patchbay-standards`, and **a base standard is never edited in place during a spec**, not in
  a consuming project and not in `patchbay-standards` itself. The change the spec would make is
  written up in `shape.md` under `## Standards retrospective (proposed, base)`: the file, the
  change, and the shipped code that proves it. That proposal becomes a pull request to
  `patchbay-standards`; a consuming project picks it up on its next sync, and until then lives
  with the standard as it is. The proposal, not a local edit, is the record. (Inside
  `patchbay-standards`, changing a base standard is a spec's feature work on its own branch,
  never a side effect of some other spec's retrospective.)
- **Project standards**, everything under `agent-os/standards/` outside `base/`, belong to the
  project and are edited in the retrospective as the questions above direct.

**Every standards edit is approved by a person, always**: a base proposal as the pull request to
`patchbay-standards`, a project standard in the project's own review of the retrospective's
change set. An agent proposes; it does not land a standard on its own.

## Keep the index in step

A standard added, renamed or removed carries its index entry in the same change set: a project
standard in the project's own sections of `agent-os/standards/index.yml`, a base proposal in the
root `index.yml` of `patchbay-standards`, where `scripts/check-index.sh` holds the index to the
files under `base/` so a proposal without its entry does not pass the gate. The index's format, the
description line and how a consuming project's index relates to the root index are
`base/process/standards-index.md`'s.

## Never edit this file from inside a retrospective

A gate that rewrites its own terms during the process it governs is precisely what this
prohibition exists for. Strengthening or relaxing the retrospective is a deliberate edit made in
its own spec, with the user, on its own branch, never inside the retrospective of some other spec.

The gate's own files are under the same rule. Which files those are, and that they change only in
a spec whose feature is the gate, are `base/process/verification-gate.md`'s.

## Recording the answer

`shape.md` gets a `## Standards Retrospective` heading. One of two shapes:

```markdown
## Standards Retrospective

Standards retrospective: no changes.
```

or

```markdown
## Standards Retrospective

- `agent-os/standards/testing/fixtures.md` — added the shared-fixture rule; this spec found
  that two adapters each built the same fake device. Verified against `tests/conftest.py` as
  shipped.
- `agent-os/standards/index.yml` — description updated for the above.
- **Deviation, not a standard change:** the dry-run flag skips the version check. One-off;
  nothing reads the version on that path.

### Standards retrospective (proposed, base)

- `base/process/standards-retrospective.md` — [the change, and the shipped code that proves
  it]. Proposed, not applied; becomes a pull request to `patchbay-standards`.
```

The `(proposed, base)` list appears only when the spec taught a base standard something; it
holds proposals and never a local edit.

## Git

The retrospective's edits are **their own change set**, separate from the feature's: a
standards change that arrives buried inside a feature diff is a standards change nobody
reviews.

Committing, pushing and staging follow the `## Git` rule in `CLAUDE.md`. "Own change set" means
the retrospective's files are listed explicitly and separately when the work is reported, so
they can be committed apart from the feature. Leaving them unlisted, mixed into a wall of
modified files, defeats the point.

## process/verification-gate

# Verification Gate

The gate is the definition of done in every patchbay repository. It is the final task of every spec,
included without asking, whether or not `/agent-os:shape-spec` shaped the work, and a spec is not
complete until every step of it passes. A spec with a red step, a skipped step or an unrecorded
retrospective is unfinished work, however small the change; a one-file fix is exactly the kind of
work that quietly invents a pattern, so the gate runs on it too.

This standard fixes the shape of the gate: what every repository's gate does and in what order.
The runnable step list is each repository's own, named in its `scripts/gate.sh` and in the gate
task of its `shape-spec.md`; this standard names no step and no tool. The standard that names a
repository's steps is cited here when it ships.

## One script

- **`scripts/gate.sh` runs every runnable step, in a fixed order, as one command**, and exits
  non-zero at the first step that fails. Later steps do not run: a failing step 1 is reported
  before step 2 has a chance to pass, so a green run means every step ran and every step passed.
- **Every step reports by name.** Each step prints a numbered banner, and what passed is named
  (`ok   <what>`) or what failed is named with its reason and the offending path; a bare exit code
  is not a report. The script ends by naming the step that follows it, so a reader of the
  transcript knows the run was not the whole gate.
- **The script runs from the repository root** wherever it is invoked from, and assumes nothing
  the repository does not already provide.

## Pinned

- **A tool's version is pinned in the script**, in one named variable per tool, with the date it
  was published beside it. The pinned tool is run through a runner that executes it without
  installing it into the project, and the runner is one the repository already assumes. Nothing
  else is installed to run the gate. A pin is bumped deliberately, in the gate's own spec, and
  the gate rerun.
- **A rule set lives in a versioned config file**, at the repository root, named in the script;
  a config the tool cannot parse fails the step. A key the tool does not know is not refused, so
  the spec that adds or changes the config shows a changed value applied, in a negative test. The
  file's header says which step reads it and that it changes only in the gate's own spec.

## The fixed order

The runnable steps come first, in the order the script runs them. Three judgment steps follow, in
this order, and nothing in the script runs them; the script's closing line names them, and the gate
task of `shape-spec.md` lists them after the runnable steps:

- **Docs**: the documentation the change touches reads true after it. The README, the repository's
  `CLAUDE.md`, the header comments and pointers in the files changed, and every standard that names
  them are read against the shipped change, and what was checked is recorded in the spec's
  `shape.md`.
- **Version**: the change is recorded under `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, and the version is
  bumped where a repository has one. Recorded in `shape.md`.
- **The standards retrospective**, per `base/process/standards-retrospective.md`: the four
  questions answered against the diff, the answer recorded in the spec's `shape.md` under
  `## Standards Retrospective`. "No changes" is valid; silence is not. It is always last.

A spec whose `shape.md` records the green run but not the three judgment steps has not finished the
gate.

## A failing step is fixed at its cause

- **The cause is fixed and the whole gate rerun from step 1.** A fix that lets the step pass
  without fixing what it reported is not a fix. Skipping the step, loosening the rule set,
  excluding the file it named or editing the script to pass each change a gate file, which the
  section below forbids inside a spec; a suppression comment placed in the file the step named
  loosens the rule for that file alone and is reviewed as the loosening it is.
- **A step that cannot pass on the shipped tree is a defect in the tree**, not a reason to bypass
  the step. The first spec in `patchbay-standards` added the one blank line `README.md` lacked
  after its heading rather than exclude the file; that is the whole of the rule.

## Every step that can fail is proven to fail

- **A step is shown to discriminate by a negative test**: a copy of the tree, broken in one way,
  that must fail that step with the named reason and the expected exit status, with the steps after
  it never reached. A step that has never been seen to fail is not known to check anything.
- **The spec that adds or changes a step ships its negative test**, and keeps the transcript in
  that spec's `verification/` folder. The tests are a script in the repository beside the gate's,
  not run by the gate, so a rerun is the same test. They run on a temporary copy outside the
  tree, never on the tree itself, and are rerun whenever the gate's files change.
- **Every spec keeps its green run** as `verification/gate-run.txt` in its spec folder, so the
  claim "gate green" has the transcript beside it. The first line of the transcript gives the date
  and the branch the run was made on, and the run is the last thing done before the work is
  handed over: an edit after the run is not covered by it. A transcript recorded before this rule
  stays as it was recorded.

## CI

- **The gate's workflow runs the same script and nothing else.** One workflow for the gate, one
  job, on every pull request and every push to the default branch: check out the repository,
  install the runner the script already assumes, run `scripts/gate.sh`. No linter, formatter,
  matrix or check is configured in it; a step the script does not run is not a gate step, and a
  check CI runs that the script does not is a gate a developer cannot run. A repository may have
  other workflows for other work; this rule is about the gate's. The judgment steps are never run
  by a machine.
- **Every action is pinned to a commit**, the full SHA in `uses:` with the tag it was taken from
  in a comment beside it, and the runner's own version is pinned through the action's input, so CI
  runs what the gate was proven with. The image is a named release, not `latest`. The job has a
  timeout, keeps no credential in the checkout and caches nothing, so it has no moving part beyond
  the script. A pin is bumped deliberately, in the gate's own spec, and the workflow rerun.
- **The workflow fails when the script fails**, because the script is one `run` step and a `run`
  step that exits non-zero fails the job. Before any push, the spec that adds or changes the
  workflow replays the job's `run` steps, read from the workflow file, on a copy of the tree with
  one script broken, and shows the job stops at that step with its exit status. That proves the
  job's control flow on the toolchain at hand, not the hosted run: the hosted run on the pull
  request is the proof of the workflow itself, and the spec records its run id and conclusion in
  `verification/` once it exists. What the script does on the hosted toolchain is the script's
  own portability, proven by its negative tests.

## The gate's own files change only in their own spec

- **The gate script, every script it runs, the rule-set config, the CI workflow and the gate task
  text in `shape-spec.md` are never changed as a side effect of a spec whose feature is something
  else**, and never from inside a retrospective. A gate that rewrites its own terms during the
  process it governs is what this rule exists to prevent.
- **A change to the gate is its own spec**, whose feature is the gate: on its own branch, with the
  owner, carrying the negative test for every step it adds or changes. A finding against a gate
  file made during some other spec is recorded in that spec's retrospective as a proposal and
  waits for the gate's spec.

## In this repository

The runnable steps are three: every script under `scripts/` parses, the standards under `base/`
and `README.md` lint clean against the pinned rule set, and `index.yml` lists exactly the tracked
files under `base/`. `scripts/gate.sh` names the tool, its pin and its config.
`scripts/check-index.sh` is the third step: it runs only in a git work tree, reads the tracked
list with `git ls-files`, refuses an untracked file under `base/` and a tracked one missing from
the disk, sorts every list after its last transform and checks both sorted before `comm`, and
holds `agent-os/standards/index.yml` to be a symlink to `../../index.yml`.
`scripts/gate-negative-tests.sh` holds every negative test, fifteen for the scripts and the CI
replay, and is parsed by step 1, not run by the gate. `.github/workflows/gate.yml` is the gate's
workflow, pinned to `actions/checkout` v7.0.1 and `astral-sh/setup-uv` v10.3.3 by commit and to
uv 0.13.7, on `ubuntu-24.04` with a ten-minute timeout, no persisted credential and no cache.
Every spec folder under `agent-os/specs/` holds its `verification/gate-run.txt`; the spec that
built the gate holds its six negative tests as recorded, and the gate spec (issue #3) holds the
current transcripts and the hosted runs by id.

## In a consuming project

This standard is synced in as `agent-os/standards/base/process/verification-gate.md`. The
project's `scripts/gate.sh` runs its own step list in this shape; its `shape-spec.md` lists those
steps in the gate task, followed by Docs, Version and the standards retrospective; its gate
workflow runs the script and nothing else; its `CLAUDE.md` names the script as the definition of
done.

## process/standards-sync (added for the revision after the review of PR 9)

Included as a feature-specific standard for the revision, as it read at `3d3e111`, the head the
review was made on; the revision rewrites it as feature work, and `shape.md` says what changed.

# Standards Sync

`base/` is written here and read everywhere: a consuming project holds a copy of it as
`agent-os/standards/base/`, beside its own standards, and the `base:` section of its
`agent-os/standards/index.yml` is the root `index.yml` of this repository. This standard fixes how
that copy is made and kept: `scripts/sync-standards.sh`, run from the project's root, and the
invariant it holds.

## What the sync writes, and nothing else

`scripts/sync-standards.sh [--init] [<path-to-patchbay-standards> [<ref>]]`, run from the project's
root, at the commit `<ref>` resolves to in that checkout (its `HEAD` by default; `<path>` defaults
to `../patchbay-standards`, the sibling checkout), writes four things:

- **`agent-os/standards/base/`**, replaced whole with `base/` as committed, so a file removed here
  is removed there.
- **`agent-os/standards/base/.version`**, the commit as forty hex digits and a newline: the one
  file under a project's `base/` that is not a standard.
- **The `base:` section of `agent-os/standards/index.yml`**, replaced with the `base:` section of
  the root `index.yml` at that commit, byte for byte. Every other line of the project's index is
  left as it was, in place and in order.
- **`scripts/sync-standards.sh`**, the project's copy, replaced with the script at that same commit
  as the sync's last act, so a project carries the version of the script that produced its tree
  and the next sync runs that version.

It reads from the commit, never the working tree: the files come out of `git archive`, so an
uncommitted edit in the checkout cannot be synced, neither a standard nor the script itself. What
it did is reported on stderr (each file added, removed or changed, the old and new commit, what
the index and the script did) and as one JSON object on stdout, for a wrapper to read. Exit 0 is a
sync whose result it exported again and found equal; 1 is a result that did not match; 2 is usage
or a precondition, each named: a bad flag, a directory that is not the top of a git work tree,
`<path>` not a patchbay-standards checkout, `<ref>` not a commit, no parseable `base:` section
without `--init`.

## The invariant

**`agent-os/standards/base/`, less `.version`, and the `base:` section of the project's index are
byte-identical to `base/` and the root `index.yml` of `patchbay-standards` at the commit in
`.version`**, and the project's `scripts/sync-standards.sh` is the script at that commit.
`scripts/sync-standards.sh --check [<path>]` holds it: it exports the pinned commit from the
checkout and names every file missing, extra or changed, whether the `base:` section differs and
whether the script does, exit 1 on any of them, writing nothing. The project's files are the
tracked ones plus the untracked ones git does not ignore, as `scripts/check-index.sh` reads them,
so an ignored `.DS_Store` is never drift. A pinned commit the checkout does not have is a
precondition (exit 2), not drift: fetch it. The check is a step of the project's gate.

No entry in the `base:` section and no file under `base/` is edited by hand. A description the
project disagrees with, a rule it would change, a standard it lacks, is changed in
`patchbay-standards` by a pull request there and taken when the project moves its pin; the
proposal shape is `base/process/standards-retrospective.md`'s.

## Pinned, not tracking

A project pins one commit and stays on it until it decides otherwise. Syncing forward is
deliberate: read this repository's `CHANGELOG.md` from the pinned commit to the target first, since
the `base/` lines of each entry are what the sync will bring in; run the sync; read what it
reports; commit the result in its own change set, titled `chore: sync base standards to <sha>`.
That commit changes nothing but `agent-os/standards/base/`, `.version`, the `base:` section and
`scripts/sync-standards.sh`. Work the new standards ask of the project's own files is its own
spec, after.

## The index

The `base:` section is the line `base:` with nothing after the colon, and every line after it that
is indented, blank or a column-0 comment, up to the last indented line: a trailing blank or comment
line and the next column-0 key are the project's. The sync replaces that span and nothing else, so
the project's own sections, its header comment, its blank lines and the comments it keeps beside
its keys come through byte for byte; test r in `scripts/gate-negative-tests.sh` holds that against
an index built by hand.

- **`--index-only [<path>]`** regenerates the section alone, from the commit in `.version`, and
  touches no file under `base/` and not the script. It is the regeneration that is safe to run on
  a synced index: a hand-edited entry is drift to `--check` and is repaired by it (test s). The
  stock `/agent-os:index-standards` rewrites the whole file and is not run on a synced index, as
  `base/process/standards-index.md` says.
- **`--init`** creates the section for a project syncing for the first time, with one blank line
  on each side, before the first column-0 key other than `root:` that sorts after `base` (above the
  column-0 comment lines directly over that key, which stay with it) or at the end, and creates
  the file when there is none. Without `--init` a missing section is refused; a `base:` line that
  is not a parseable section (a second `base:` line, or content after the colon) is refused either

`scripts/sync-standards.sh` lives here and is run from a consuming project; here
`agent-os/standards/base` is a symlink and the script refuses to run (exit 2, test u). It is a
gate file in every project, so it changes only in its own spec here, carrying its negative tests:
o to v in `scripts/gate-negative-tests.sh`, each on a scratch checkout whose `HEAD` holds the
working tree's files beside a scratch Agent OS project with its own index sections and standards,
the sync run from the project with the sibling checkout as the default path. Gate step 1 parses
the script.

## In a consuming project

This standard is synced in as `agent-os/standards/base/process/standards-sync.md`. The project's
checkout of `patchbay-standards` sits beside it as `../patchbay-standards`. The first sync is run
from the checkout's copy, `../patchbay-standards/scripts/sync-standards.sh --init`, which installs
`scripts/sync-standards.sh`; every later sync and check runs the project's copy.
`scripts/sync-standards.sh --check` is a step of the project's `scripts/gate.sh`, and the project's
gate workflow checks out `patchbay-standards` beside the project, one more checkout step pinned
as the gate standard directs, so the hosted run compares against the real thing.
