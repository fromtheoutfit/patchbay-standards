# Shape Spec

Gather context and structure planning for significant work. **Run this command while in plan mode.**

## Important Guidelines

- **Always use AskUserQuestion tool** when asking the user anything
- **Offer suggestions** — Present options the user can confirm, adjust, or correct
- **Keep it lightweight** — This is shaping, not exhaustive documentation

## Prerequisites

This command **must be run in plan mode**.

**Before proceeding, check if you are currently in plan mode.**

If NOT in plan mode, **stop immediately** and tell the user:

```
Shape-spec must be run in plan mode. Please enter plan mode first, then run /shape-spec again.
```

Do not proceed with any steps below until confirmed to be in plan mode.

## Process

### Step 1: Clarify What We're Building

Use AskUserQuestion to understand the scope:

```
What are we building? Please describe the feature or change.

(Be as specific as you like — I'll ask follow-up questions if needed)
```

Based on their response, ask 1-2 clarifying questions if the scope is unclear. Examples:
- "Is this a new feature or a change to existing functionality?"
- "What's the expected outcome when this is done?"
- "Are there any constraints or requirements I should know about?"

### Step 2: Gather Visuals

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
Do you have any visuals to reference?

- Mockups or wireframes
- Screenshots of similar features
- Examples from other apps

(Paste images, share file paths, or say "none")
```

If visuals are provided, note them for inclusion in the spec folder.

### Step 3: Identify Reference Implementations

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
Is there similar code in this codebase I should reference?

Examples:
- "The retrospective standard is the shape every process standard should follow"
- "Look at how scripts/check-index.sh walks base/"
- "No existing references"

(Point me to files, folders, or features to study)
```

If references are provided, read and analyze them to inform the plan.

### Step 4: Check Product Context

Check if `agent-os/product/` exists and contains files.

If it exists, read key files (like `mission.md`, `roadmap.md`, `tech-stack.md`) and use AskUserQuestion:

```
I found product context in agent-os/product/. Should this feature align with any specific product goals or constraints?

Key points from your product docs:
- [summarize relevant points]

(Confirm alignment or note any adjustments)
```

If no product folder exists, skip this step.

### Step 5: Surface Relevant Standards

Standards come in two kinds, and the difference matters here and again in the gate:

- **Base standards** live under `base/` in this repository and are synced into every consuming
  project as `agent-os/standards/base/`, pinned to a commit. They are owned by this repository
  (`patchbay-standards`). **A base standard is never edited in place during a spec**, not here
  and not in a consuming project. A change the spec would make to one is recorded in `shape.md`
  under `## Standards retrospective (proposed, base)` and becomes a pull request to this
  repository, approved by a person. Changing a base standard is a spec's own feature work on its
  own branch, never a side effect of another spec's retrospective.
- **Project standards**, a consuming project's own files outside `base/`, belong to that project
  and change in its retrospective.

#### Step 5a: Core Architecture (always included)

*Empty for now.* The first base standards will fill this tier: the standards that apply to every
spec in every patchbay repository, included without asking, with their full content in
`standards.md`. Until then, record "none yet; see Step 5a" under a "Core Architecture" heading in
`shape.md`, so the gap stays visible rather than silently reading as "nothing applies".

#### Step 5b: Feature-Specific Standards

Read `agent-os/standards/index.yml` to identify standards relevant to the feature being built
(in addition to the core tier above, once it exists). Its `base:` section is this repository's own
`index.yml`, keyed by path relative to `base/` without the `.md`; `agent-os/standards/base` resolves
to `base/`, so `base/process/standards-retrospective` is `base/process/standards-retrospective.md`.

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:

```
The core architecture tier (Step 5a) is empty for now; nothing is included without asking.

These standards may apply:

1. **{folder/standard}** — {what it covers}
2. **{folder/standard}** — {what it covers}

Should I include these in the spec? (yes / adjust: remove 2, add {folder/standard})
```

Read the confirmed standards files to include their content in the plan context.

**What you read here is a snapshot.** `standards.md` records the standards *as they read
when the spec was shaped*. If the work teaches them something, they change at the END of
the spec, in the retrospective (gate step 4) — not by editing `standards.md` after the fact.
If the plan needs a pattern no standard covers, that is a standards change to decide with
the user now, not an ad-hoc call to make during implementation. For a base standard that
decision is a proposal (see above), never an in-place edit.

### Step 6: Generate Spec Folder Name

Create a folder name using this format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-{feature-slug}/
```

Where:
- Date/time is current timestamp
- Feature slug is derived from the feature description (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars)

Example: `2026-01-15-1430-user-comment-system/`

**Note:** If `agent-os/specs/` doesn't exist, create it when saving the spec folder.

### Step 7: Structure the Plan

Now build the plan with **Task 1 always being "Save spec documentation"**.

Present this structure to the user:

```
Here's the plan structure. Task 1 saves all our shaping work before implementation begins.

---

## Task 1: Save Spec Documentation

Create `agent-os/specs/{folder-name}/` with:

- **plan.md** — This full plan
- **shape.md** — Shaping notes (scope, decisions, context from our conversation)
- **standards.md** — Relevant standards that apply to this work
- **references.md** — Pointers to reference implementations studied
- **visuals/** — Any mockups or screenshots provided

## Task 2: [First implementation task]

[Description based on the feature]

## Task 3: [Next task]

...

## Task N (FINAL — ALWAYS INCLUDED): Verification gate

Run the full verification gate, in order. The spec is not complete until every step passes:

1. `bash -n` on every file under `scripts/` — every script must parse
2. `pymarkdown` through `uvx` (version pinned in `scripts/gate.sh`, rules in `.pymarkdown.yaml`)
   over `base/` and `README.md` — must report no findings
3. `scripts/check-index.sh` — `index.yml` lists exactly the files under `base/`: every file has
   an entry, no entry lacks a file, and `agent-os/standards/index.yml` is identical to it
4. **Standards retrospective** — per `base/process/standards-retrospective.md`:
   check what this spec taught against the standards, add any pattern it invented,
   correct anything it proved stale, and keep `index.yml` in step — as an edit for a
   project standard, as a proposal under `## Standards retrospective (proposed, base)` for
   a base standard. List those edits separately from the feature's when reporting, so they
   can be committed apart from it. If the spec taught nothing, record
   `Standards retrospective: no changes` in `shape.md`. "No changes" is valid; silence is not.

`scripts/gate.sh` runs steps 1–3 as one command. Step 4 is judgment, recorded in `shape.md`.

If any step fails, fix the underlying issue (do not bypass) and rerun before marking the
spec complete.

---

Does this plan structure look right? I'll fill in the implementation tasks next.
```

### Step 8: Complete the Plan

After Task 1 is confirmed, continue building out the remaining implementation tasks based on:
- The feature scope from Step 1
- Patterns from reference implementations (Step 3)
- Constraints from standards (Step 5)

Each task should be specific and actionable.

**Always include the final verification task** (`scripts/gate.sh` — `bash -n`, `pymarkdown`,
`scripts/check-index.sh` — plus the standards retrospective) as the last task in every plan,
regardless of feature size. Do not skip this for "small" changes — a one-file fix is exactly the
kind of spec that quietly invents a pattern.

### Step 9: Ready for Execution

When the full plan is ready:

```
Plan complete. When you approve and execute:

1. Task 1 will save all spec documentation first
2. Then implementation tasks will proceed
3. The final task runs the verification gate, ending with the standards
   retrospective. The spec is not complete until the gate is green AND the
   standards are either updated (or proposed, for base/) or recorded as "no changes"

Ready to start? (approve / adjust)
```

## Output Structure

The spec folder will contain:

```
agent-os/specs/{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-feature-slug}/
├── plan.md           # The full plan
├── shape.md          # Shaping decisions and context
├── standards.md      # Which standards apply and key points
├── references.md     # Pointers to similar code
└── visuals/          # Mockups, screenshots (if any)
```

## shape.md Content

The shape.md file should capture:

```markdown
# {Feature Name} — Shaping Notes

## Core Architecture (Non-Negotiable)

None yet; see Step 5a. The first base standards will fill this tier.

## Scope

[What we're building, from Step 1]

## Decisions

- [Key decisions made during shaping]
- [Constraints or requirements noted]

## Context

- **Visuals:** [List of visuals provided, or "None"]
- **References:** [Code references studied]
- **Product alignment:** [Notes from product context, or "N/A"]

## Standards Applied

**Core (always applied):**
- none yet (Step 5a)

**Feature-specific:**
- {folder/standard} — [why it applies]

## Standards Retrospective

Per `base/process/standards-retrospective.md`. Filled in at the END of the
spec, from the shipped diff — not at shaping time. "No changes" is valid; silence is not.

Either:

`Standards retrospective: no changes.`

Or a list, each entry naming the standard, what the spec taught it, and the shipped file
that verifies it:

- `{project standard}` — [what changed, and the code that proves it]
- `agent-os/standards/index.yml` — [updated for the above]
- **Deviation, not a standard change:** [what we did differently and why it stays a one-off]

### Standards retrospective (proposed, base)

Only when the spec taught a base standard something. Proposals, never local edits; each
becomes a pull request to `patchbay-standards`, approved by a person.

- `base/{folder/standard}.md` — [the change, and the shipped code that proves it]

## Verification Gate

Spec is not complete until `scripts/gate.sh` passes — `bash -n` on every file under
`scripts/`, `pymarkdown` over `base/` and `README.md`, and `scripts/check-index.sh` —
and the standards retrospective above is filled in.
```

## standards.md Content

Include the full content of each relevant standard:

```markdown
# Standards for {Feature Name}

The following standards apply to this work, as they read when the spec was shaped
(before the retrospective). If this spec changed or proposed a change to any of them,
`shape.md`'s Standards Retrospective says which and why — this file is the snapshot, not
the current text.

---

## {folder/standard}

[Full content of the standard file]
```

## references.md Content

```markdown
# References for {Feature Name}

## Similar Implementations

### {Reference 1 name}

- **Location:** `{path}`
- **Relevance:** [Why this is relevant]
- **Key patterns:** [What to borrow from this]

### {Reference 2 name}

...
```

## Tips

- **Keep shaping fast** — Don't over-document. Capture enough to start, refine as you build.
- **Visuals are optional** — Not every feature needs mockups.
- **Feature-specific standards inform the plan** — If the plan conflicts with one, revise the plan, or record in `shape.md` why the standard doesn't apply here. A standard that's simply wrong gets fixed in the retrospective, not worked around — and a base standard gets *proposed*, not edited.
- **Specs are discoverable** — Months later, someone can find this spec and understand what was built and why.
- **The gate is the definition of done** — A spec with a script that does not parse, a lint finding, an index out of step with `base/`, or an unwritten retrospective is unfinished work, however small the change.
- **Standards are a living record** — The retrospective in gate step 4 is how they grow. A spec that taught nothing says so in `shape.md`; a spec that taught something changes a standard (or proposes a base change) in its own change set, verified against the shipped code rather than the plan.
